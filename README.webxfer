webxfer - HTTP script execution

To setup webxfer one needs to add the following line to
/etc/inetd.conf:

  webxferd stream tcp nowait root /PLACE/OF/in.webxferd in.webxferd

/etc/services should contain something like (assuming one wishes to
use port 9876 for all communication):

  webxferd		9876/tcp
  webxferd		9876/udp
